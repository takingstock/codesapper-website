            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>Apart from the basic details in the video and the architecture provided above, i would like to add my motivations on starting this. Having served as a lead for dev teams, analytics teams and a CTO for a startup, i always felt short handed when it came to performing reviews and doing them effectively, covering ALL aspects of the process. I would love to find a community of like minded sufferer's and work with them to help releive some of the pain.. i kid you not.</p>

            <h2>Contribute</h2>
            <p>Hi there! Thanks for dropping by. I hope you got a basic idea about the project and it has somewhat piqued your interest. Please go through the GitHub page and dive deeper. This is still a work in progress, so it would be amazing to have a community of folks interested in contributing to this effort. Please drop an email at <a href="mailto:vikram.murthy@gmail.com">vikram.murthy@gmail.com</a> stating what it is that you would like to start with! Hopefully, in the next couple of months, we will get a Discord channel for much better communication, but for now, the priority is to get the project working end-to-end for a few languages.</p>
